is a family of diffusion/image models by [black forest labs](https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-black-forest-labs/). By people who were behind Stability AI (company that developed SDXL).

#### What is Flux?
is a cutting-edge AI image generator created by Black Forest Labs, the same team behind popular Stable Diffusion. its designed to push the boundaries of whats possible with Artificial intelligence in a visual creativity. At its core, FLUX.1 utilizes advanced algorithms to transform text prompts into highly detailed and visually stunning images. 

# Model Variants
To strike a balance between accessibility and model capabilities, FLUX.1 comes in three variants: FLUX.1 pro, FLUX.1 dev and FLUX.1 schnell

#### 1. FLUX.1 pro
The best of FLUX.1, offering state-of-the-art performance image generation with top of the line prompt following, visual quality, image detail and output diversity.
- Its closed licensed model accessible via APIs only.
- Its ultimate tool for professional and big companies.
- Its great at following instructions and creating super-detailed high-quality images. 

#### 2. FLUX.1 dev
is an open-weight, guidance-distilled model for non-commercial applications. Directly distilled from FLUX.1 pro, FLUX.1 dev obtains similar quality and prompt adherence capabilities, while being more efficient than a standard model of the same size.
- Its perfect for playing around with ideas and testing creative concepts for non-commercial use.
- good for training LoRAs 

#### 3. FLUX.1 schnell
its the fastest model, is tailored for local development and personal use. FLUX.1 schnell is openly available under an Apache2.0 license.
